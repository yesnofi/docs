# üìñ Terms of Use

Welcome to Yesnofi! These Terms of Use (hereinafter referred to as ‚ÄúTerms‚Äù) form a legal agreement between you (‚ÄúUser‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äù) and the Yesnofi platform (‚ÄúPlatform‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe‚Äù), outlining your rights and obligations when using the Yesnofi decentralized binary prediction market platform. Please read these Terms carefully before using Yesnofi. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please do not use the Platform.

---

### **1. Platform Overview**

Yesnofi is a decentralized prediction market platform where users can create and participate in prediction questions by connecting a Web3 wallet. The Platform is based on blockchain technology and offers account-less login, publicly transparent transaction records, and a fair market mechanism.

---

### **2. Eligibility Requirements**

* **Legal Age:** You must be at least 18 years old or meet the legal age requirements of your jurisdiction, and you must not be listed on any sanctions list (such as the OFAC list) to use Yesnofi.
* **Compliance:** You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using Yesnofi and refrain from engaging in any illegal or Terms-violating activities.
* **Wallet Connection:** When using the Platform, you are required to connect a compatible Web3 wallet (such as MetaMask). You bear full responsibility for the security of your wallet and the management of your private keys.
* **Geographical Restrictions:** Access from jurisdictions such as the United States, mainland China, Singapore, and others where restricted is explicitly prohibited. Using a VPN to bypass these restrictions will be considered a material breach.
* **Anti-Money Laundering Commitment:** The user guarantees that the funds are legally sourced and agrees not to use the Platform for money laundering, tax evasion, or terrorist financing.

---

### **3. Account-less Model and Identity Verification**

* The Platform does not require users to register an account, as identity is verified solely through wallet signatures.
* Due to its decentralized nature, Yesnofi does not store any personal information or private keys, and all transaction records are publicly available on the blockchain.

---

### **4. Prediction Market Rules**

#### **4.1 Creation of Prediction Questions**

* Any user can create a prediction question; however, the content of the question must not involve illegal, fraudulent, misleading, or morally inappropriate topics.
* When creating a question, the user must provide a clear description, specify the voting rules, and detail the verification method to ensure the fairness and verifiability of the question.
* Creating a question requires spending Yesno tokens, with the specific amount determined by the Platform‚Äôs rules.

#### **4.2 Market Betting**

* Users can place bets on any option within a prediction question on the Platform, with the betting amount calculated in USDT.
* Certain questions may operate under a ‚Äúwinner-takes-all‚Äù mode, meaning that users can only choose ‚ÄúYes‚Äù when placing a bet.
* Users are required to authorize USDT tokens for their first bet; the authorized amount is used only for that particular question and for no other purpose.

#### **4.3 Resolution and Dispute Mechanism**

* After the voting ends, the question creator can submit a resolution, initiating a 12-hour challenge period.
* If any user disputes the outcome, they may initiate a challenge within this period by staking 500 USDT as collateral.
* Should the dispute escalate to arbitration, the final decision will be made by the Platform‚Äôs community and advisory panel, and the result of the arbitration shall be final.

---

### **5. Transactions and Fees**

* All bets, question creations, and other transactions are executed via smart contracts on the blockchain; the Platform does not handle funds directly.
* The Platform may charge a certain percentage fee for creating questions, placing bets, or using the dispute mechanism. The specific fee rates are determined by the Platform‚Äôs rules and published on the official website.
* Users are solely responsible for all network fees (e.g., Gas fees) incurred while using the Platform.

---

### **6. User Responsibility and Risk Disclosure**

#### **6.1 Funds and Security**

* Users must manage their own wallets and private keys. Yesnofi is not responsible for any loss of funds resulting from lost wallets, leaked keys, or malicious operations.
* Yesnofi does not provide custodial services; all fund transactions are executed by smart contracts and cannot be reversed or modified.

#### **6.2 Prediction Market Risks**

* Prediction markets carry inherent high risks, and all bet outcomes are subject to market fluctuations. Users should independently assess these risks.
* Yesnofi does not guarantee the final outcome of any question, market changes, or user earnings.

#### **6.3 Legal Compliance**

* Users must ensure that their use of Yesnofi does not violate the laws and regulations of their respective countries or regions.
* If the use of blockchain prediction markets is prohibited in the user's location, the user should cease using Yesnofi immediately, and the Platform will not be held liable.

---

### **7. Platform Disclaimers**

* As a decentralized Platform, Yesnofi is not responsible for any user actions, the fairness of prediction questions, or market outcomes.
* The Platform is not liable for any losses resulting from hacking, smart contract vulnerabilities, blockchain network failures, or other force majeure events.
* Yesnofi is not responsible for any losses incurred from using the Platform (including, but not limited to, financial losses, data loss, or failed transactions).
* The Platform does not provide any express or implied warranties regarding the accuracy or security of the contract code; by using the Platform, users accept it on an ‚Äúas-is‚Äù basis.
* Losses arising from wallet services (e.g., MetaMask), blockchain network failures, or miner operations are not the responsibility of the Platform.
* User-generated content (UGC) is solely the responsibility of its creators. While the Platform reserves the right to remove non-compliant questions, it is under no obligation to review them.
* Under any circumstances, the cumulative liability of any affiliates of the Platform shall not exceed 10% of the fees paid by the user in the last 12 months.

### **8. Termination and Restriction of Use**

* Yesnofi reserves the right to restrict or terminate a user‚Äôs access if it is determined that the user is engaged in fraud, abuse, illegal activities, or other misconduct.
* Users may cease using the Platform at any time without notifying the Platform.

---

### **9. Intellectual Property**

* All software, code, interface design, and content on the Yesnofi Platform are protected by open-source licenses or other intellectual property rights.
* Users may use, modify, or contribute to the Yesnofi code provided they comply with the applicable open-source licenses.

---

### **10. Dispute Resolution**

* In the event of a dispute between the user and the Platform, both parties should first attempt to resolve the issue through community communication.
* If an agreement cannot be reached, the dispute shall be submitted to the Yesnofi advisory panel or community arbitration mechanism, whose decision will be final and binding.

---

### **11. Important Risk Disclosure**

* **Cryptocurrency Risk:** The value of digital assets such as USDT may fluctuate dramatically, potentially leading to a significant change in bet values or a total loss.
* **Technical Risk:** Despite audits, smart contracts may still contain vulnerabilities. Hacking or protocol flaws could result in irreversible fund losses.
* **Regulatory Uncertainty:** Some jurisdictions may consider prediction markets as gambling or financial instruments. Users are responsible for their own compliance obligations.
* **Irreversibility:** Blockchain transactions cannot be undone. Any losses resulting from operational errors (e.g., transferring funds to the wrong address) are irreversible.

---

### **12. Enhanced Compliance Provisions**

* **Tax Obligations:** Users are responsible for reporting any taxes arising from their betting earnings; the Platform does not provide tax documents or guidance.
* **Law Enforcement Cooperation:** Although the Platform does not store user data, it will respond to lawful requests for on-chain data analysis from relevant jurisdictions.
* **Token Nature Statement:** The YESNO token is intended solely for governance purposes and does not constitute a security, equity, or investment contract.

---

### **13. Amendments and Termination of the Agreement**

* **Right to Unilaterally Modify:** Yesnofi reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. The updated Terms will be posted on the official website, and continued use of Yesnofi will be deemed acceptance of the latest Terms.
* **Right to Interrupt Services:** Due to regulatory pressure or security incidents, the Platform may permanently terminate the agreement. Users will have 30 days to withdraw their assets.
