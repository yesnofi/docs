### Share NFT Introduction

Share NFTs are tokens issued using the ERC1155 standard. When users bet on a specific option in the question market, an NFT related to that option's answer is generated, serving as a betting ticket.

#### How It Works

- **Generation**: When users bet on an option in the question market, a corresponding ERC1155 NFT is generated.
- **Returns**: If the selected option becomes the final correct answer, users holding NFTs corresponding to this option will be able to redeem bonuses.
- **Trading**: These NFTs can be bought and sold on any NFT trading platform that supports ERC1155, enabling liquidity and potential value appreciation.

#### Advantages

1. **Liquidity**: By trading NFTs on public markets, users' betting options have value even before results are revealed.
2. **Risk Diversification**: Holding NFTs for multiple options minimizes betting risks.
3. **Transparency**: All betting transactions and holding records are publicly transparent and traceable.
4. **Diverse Market Participation**: Users can gain market exposure to different questions through trading.
