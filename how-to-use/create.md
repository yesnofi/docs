# ✍️ Create Questions

After logging in, users can click the [Create] button on the platform to enter the question creation page. The following parameters need to be filled when creating a question:

1. **Title**
   - Briefly describe the question topic in one sentence.
2. **Description**
   - Provide detailed explanation of the question's resolution criteria to ensure clarity. For example: when predicting BTC price, specify which exchange and trading pair's K-line chart will be used as reference for later verification.
3. **Logo**
   - Upload an icon that visually represents the question topic.
4. **Start Time**
   - Specify when voting begins. Can be set to current time or a future moment.
5. **End Time**
   - Set the deadline for voting.
6. **Deadline**
   - Indicates the reference time when solutions might be proposed after the question ends (temporary time, for reference only).
7. **Edit Options**
   - If the question has multiple options (e.g., "Which countries will Trump visit in 2025?"), you can edit the content of each option here.
8. **Winner Takes All**
   - If a question has multiple options but only one can win (e.g., "Which country will Trump visit first after taking office?"), the platform will only allow predicting [Yes] for options, while [No] options will be disabled.
   - When an option is determined to be [Yes], other options will automatically be marked as [No], and users who bet [Yes] will receive bonuses from the betting shares of other options.
9. **Question Option Settings**
   - Each option can have its own Logo and title for easy distinction and display.
10. **Confirm Creation**
    - Click the [Create] button to submit the question.
    - **Authorization Note**:
      - Creating a question requires authorization to consume a certain amount of [Yesno] tokens.
      - The current authorized deduction of [Yesno] tokens is a fixed amount (specific value to be announced, free creation in early stages).
11. **Creation Complete**
    - Upon successful creation, the system will automatically redirect to the question details page, and users can also view their created questions list in their personal center.
