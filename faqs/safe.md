# üîê Security and Authorization Statement

To ensure platform security and fairness, Yesnofi has implemented authorization and verification mechanisms at multiple stages:

- **Wallet Connection and Signature**:

  - Signature-based login ensures that every action is initiated by the wallet genuinely controlled by the user, preventing impersonation and malicious operations.

- **Token Authorization**:

  - A one-time token authorization is required before placing a bet to allow the platform to access USDT funds. This is to ensure the platform has permission to use user funds for betting and to reduce security risks caused by malicious activities.
  - Similarly, creating a question requires authorization to consume „ÄêYesno„Äë tokens. This is to verify user identity and ensure sufficient funds.

- **Decentralized Verification**:
  - All operations are recorded on the blockchain, making the process transparent and publicly verifiable.
  - The challenge and dispute period mechanisms further ensure fairness and integrity in the answer confirmation process.
